# Workshop_3_1_CodingSchool

The aim of this app is to build an app for a coding school similar to app from workshop 2_1, but this time using servlets.

Main training purposes of this app are:
- create a web app using pure servlet classes
- connection with database using DataSource class (+getConnection() method) and context.xml file instead of DriverManager class as before
- train viewing results from sql queries on jsp files, using c:taglib forms and foreach
- use of Dao classes to perform CRUD operations on database
